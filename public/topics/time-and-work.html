    <h2><strong>&nbsp;Time and Work</strong></h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Basic Concepts</strong>: Deals with the rate of work done by individuals or groups.</li>
      <li><strong>Key Formulas</strong>:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Work = Rate &times; Time</li>
        <li>Combined work rates for multiple workers.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Applications</strong>: Problems involving multiple people working together or against each other, time required to complete a job, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Points to remember:</strong></p>
    <p>1) If a man can do a piece of work in n days, work done by him in one day = part of total work or he will finish work in one day.</p>
    <p>2) If a man completes work in one day, he will complete the entire work in n days.</p>
    <p>3) If A can complete a piece of work in X days and B can complete the same work in Y days, both A and B working together can finish the same work in days.</p>
    <p>4) If A is thrice as good as workman as B or A can work three times faster than B, the ratio of work done by A and B for the same duration of time will be = 3:1. And the ratio of time taken by A and B to finish the same amount of work will be = 1:3.</p>
    <p>5) A, B and C can do a work in D1, D2 and D3 days respectively. If they work for X1, X2 and X3 days respectively;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Work done by A in X1 days =</li>
      <li>Work done by B in X2 days =</li>
      <li>Work done by C in X3 days =</li>
    </ul>
    <p>6) If A, B, C can do a piece of work in X, Y, and Z days respectively, if they work together they can do the same work in days.</p>

    <!-- Example and Solutions -->
    <h3>Examples</h3>

    <p><strong>Question 1:</strong></p>
    <div class="solution">
      <p><strong>A can complete a task in 10 days, and B can do the same task in 15 days. If they work together, how many days will they take to complete the task?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Work done by A in 1 day = 1/10</p>
      <p>Work done by B in 1 day = 1/15</p>
      <p>Together, work done in 1 day = 1/10 + 1/15 = (3 + 2) / 30 = 5/30 = 1/6</p>
      <p>So, A and B together will take 6 days to complete the task.</p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Question 2:</strong></p>
    <div class="solution">
      <p><strong>A can complete a task in 12 days, while B can complete the same task in 8 days. If A and B work on alternate days, starting with A, in how many days will the task be completed?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Work done by A in 1 day = 1/12</p>
      <p>Work done by B in 1 day = 1/8</p>
      <p>In 2 days, A and B together will complete:</p>
      <p>= 1/12 + 1/8</p>
      <p>= (2 + 3) / 24</p>
      <p>= 5/24 of the task.</p>
      <p>Total task = 1.</p>
      <p>Let the number of full cycles (2 days each) be n.</p>
      <p>So, n &times; 5/24 of the work is completed in 2n days.</p>
      <p>If we solve for n, we get n=4.</p>
      <p>In 8 days, A and B together complete 20/24 of the task. A will take the next 2/12 days (or 1/6 of the day) to finish it.</p>
      <p>So, the total time taken will be 9.33 days (or 9 days and 4 hours).</p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Question 3:</strong></p>
    <div class="solution">
      <p><strong>A and B together can complete a task in 6 days, but A alone can complete it in 9 days. How long will B take to complete the task alone?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Work done by A in 1 day = 1/9</p>
      <p>Work done by A and B together in 1 day = 1/6</p>
      <p>Work done by B in 1 day = 1/6 - 1/9 = (3 - 2) / 18 = 1/18</p>
      <p>So, B alone will take 18 days to complete the task.</p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Question 4:</strong></p>
    <div class="solution">
      <p><strong>A can complete 60% of a task in 9 days. How many more days will A take to complete the rest of the task?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>60% of the task is completed in 9 days.</p>
      <p>So, work done in 1 day = 60% / 9 = 6.67% of the task per day.</p>
      <p>Remaining work = 40%.</p>
      <p>Days required to complete 40% of the task = 40% / 6.67% per day = 6 days.</p>
      <p>So, A will take 6 more days to complete the rest of the task.</p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Question 5:</strong></p>
    <div class="solution">
      <p><strong>A and B together can complete a task in 12 days, while B alone can complete it in 20 days. How long will A take to complete the task alone?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Work done by A and B together in 1 day = 1/12</p>
      <p>Work done by B in 1 day = 1/20</p>
      <p>Work done by A in 1 day = 1/12 - 1/20 = (5 - 3) / 60 = 2/60 = 1/30</p>
      <p>So, A alone will take 30 days to complete the task.</p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Question 6:</strong></p>
    <div class="solution">
      <p><strong>If 5 workers can complete a job in 20 days, how many more workers are needed to complete the job in 10 days?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Let the total work be W.</p>
      <p>Work done by 5 workers in 20 days = W.</p>
      <p>Work done by 1 worker in 1 day = W / (5 &times; 20) = W/100.</p>
      <p>If the task needs to be completed in 10 days,</p>
      <p>Let the number of workers required be N.</p>
      <p>Work done by N workers in 10 days = W,</p>
      <p>So, N &times; W/100 &times; 10 = W.</p>
      <p>N = 10 workers.</p>
      <p>Since there are already 5 workers, 5 more workers are needed.</p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Question 7:</strong></p>
    <div class="solution">
      <p><strong>A can complete a task in 15 days, and B can complete it in 10 days. If they work together for 5 days, how much of the task will be left?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Work done by A in 1 day = 1/15</p>
      <p>Work done by B in 1 day = 1/10</p>
      <p>Together, work done in 1 day = 1/15 + 1/10 = (2 + 3) / 30 = 5/30 = 1/6.</p>
      <p>Work done by A and B together in 5 days = 5 &times; 1/6 = 5/6.</p>
      <p>Remaining work = 1 - 5/6 = 1/6.</p>
      <p>So, 1/6 of the task will be left.</p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Question 8:</strong></p>
    <div class="solution">
      <p><strong>A can complete a task in 8 days, B in 12 days, and C in 16 days. How long will it take for A, B, and C together to complete the task?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Work done by A in 1 day = 1/8</p>
      <p>Work done by B in 1 day = 1/12</p>
      <p>Work done by C in 1 day = 1/16</p>
      <p>Together, work done in 1 day = 1/8 + 1/12 + 1/16</p>
      <p>= (6 + 4 + 3) / 48</p>
      <p>= 13/48.</p>
      <p>So, A, B, and C together will take 48/13 days &asymp; 3.69 days to complete the task.</p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Question 9:</strong></p>
    <div class="solution">
      <p><strong>A and B can complete a task in 10 days, and B and C can complete it in 12 days. If A, B, and C together can complete the task in 8 days, how long will A and C take to complete the task together?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Work done by A, B, and C together in 1 day = 1/8</p>
      <p>Work done by A and B together in 1 day = 1/10</p>
      <p>Work done by B and C together in 1 day = 1/12</p>
      <p>Let the work done by A, B, and C in 1 day be A, B, and C.</p>
      <p>A + B + C = 1/8</p>
      <p>A + B = 1/10</p>
      <p>B + C = 1/12.</p>
      <p>Subtract (A + B + C) - (A + B) = C = 1/8 - 1/10 = (5 - 4) / 40 = 1/40.</p>
      <p>Similarly, find the work for A. A + C = 1 - 1/40 = 9/40.</p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Question 10:</strong></p>
    <div class="solution">
      <p><strong>A is 50% more efficient than B. If A alone can complete a task in 18 days, how long will B take to complete the same task alone?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Efficiency of A : Efficiency of B = 150 : 100 = 3 : 2.</p>
      <p>So, if A takes 18 days to complete the task,</p>
      <p>B will take 18 &times; (3/2) = 27 days.</p>
      <p>So, B alone will take 27 days to complete the task.</p>
