    <h2><strong>&nbsp;Problems on Ages</strong></h2>

    <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
    <p>Problems on ages are a common topic in aptitude tests and competitive exams. They involve determining the ages of individuals based on given conditions or relationships between their ages. These problems often require the use of algebra to solve equations representing the ages.</p>

    <p><strong>Key Concepts</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Basic Relationships:</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Ages can be expressed in terms of years. For example, if the current age of a person is <em>x</em>, after <em>n</em> years, their age will be <em>x+n</em>.</li>
        <li>Conversely, to find the age <em>n</em> years ago, subtract <em>n</em> from the current age: <em>x-n</em>.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Setting Up Equations:</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Problems often provide relationships or conditions between the ages of two or more individuals. For example, "A is twice as old as B" can be represented as <em>A = 2B</em>.</li>
        <li>Equations can be set up based on given information and then solved to find the unknown ages.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Common Scenarios:</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sum of Ages:</strong> Problems may require calculating the total of multiple ages.</li>
        <li><strong>Age Differences:</strong> Some problems provide the difference in ages and require finding individual ages.</li>
        <li><strong>Future and Past Ages:</strong> Many age problems will involve calculating ages at a future date or in the past.</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Strategies for Solving Age Problems</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Identify Variables:</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Assign variables to the unknown ages. For example, let <em>A</em> represent the age of person A and <em>B</em> represent the age of person B.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Translate the Information:</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Convert the problem statement into mathematical equations using the relationships provided.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Solve the Equations:</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Use algebraic techniques to solve for the unknown variables. This may involve simplifying equations and isolating variables.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Check the Solution:</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>After finding the ages, substitute the values back into the original equations to ensure they satisfy all conditions given in the problem.</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Common Mistakes</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Neglecting to Read Carefully:</strong> Many age problems include critical details that can be easily overlooked.</li>
      <li><strong>Incorrect Assumptions:</strong> Make sure not to assume any age without proper relationships provided.</li>
      <li><strong>Ignoring Units:</strong> Ensure that all ages are in the same units (e.g., years) when calculating.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Examples</h3>

    <!-- Example 1 -->
    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong><br />The sum of the ages of John and his sister is 30 years. If John is 4 years older than his sister, what are their ages?</p>
    <div class="solution">
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Let the sister's age be <em>x</em>.</p>
      <p>Then John's age = <em>x + 4</em></p>
      <p>According to the problem:<br /> <em>x + (x + 4) = 30</em><br /> <em>2x + 4 = 30</em><br /> <em>2x = 26</em><br /> <em>x = 13</em></p>
      <p>So, John's age = 13 + 4 = 17.</p>
      <p><strong>Ages:</strong> John is 17 years old, and his sister is 13 years old.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Example 2 -->
    <p><strong>Example 2:</strong><br />A father is three times as old as his son. In 12 years, he will be twice as old as his son. What are their current ages?</p>
    <div class="solution">
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Let the son's age be <em>x</em>.</p>
      <p>Then the father's age = <em>3x</em>.</p>
      <p>In 12 years:<br /> <em>3x + 12 = 2(x + 12)</em><br /> <em>3x + 12 = 2x + 24</em><br /> <em>x = 12</em></p>
      <p>So, the father's age is 3 &times; 12 = 36.</p>
      <p><strong>Ages:</strong> The father is 36 years old, and the son is 12 years old.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Example 3 -->
    <p><strong>Example 3:</strong><br />The age of Alice is twice the age of Bob. If Alice is 20 years old, how old is Bob?</p>
    <div class="solution">
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Let Bob's age be <em>x</em>.</p>
      <p>According to the problem:<br /> <em>2x = 20</em><br /> <em>x = 10</em></p>
      <p><strong>Ages:</strong> Bob is 10 years old.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Example 4 -->
    <p><strong>Example 4:</strong><br />If the present age of a mother is 4 times that of her daughter and the sum of their ages is 60 years, what are their ages?</p>
    <div class="solution">
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Let the daughter's age be <em>x</em>.</p>
      <p>Then the mother's age = <em>4x</em>.</p>
      <p>According to the problem:<br /> <em>x + 4x = 60</em><br /> <em>5x = 60</em><br /> <em>x = 12</em></p>
      <p>So, the mother's age is 4 &times; 12 = 48.</p>
      <p><strong>Ages:</strong> The mother is 48 years old, and the daughter is 12 years old.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Example 5 -->
    <p><strong>Example 5:</strong><br />In 5 years, Lisa will be 25 years old. What is her current age?</p>
    <div class="solution">
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Let Lisa's current age be <em>x</em>.</p>
      <p>According to the problem:<br /> <em>x + 5 = 25</em><br /> <em>x = 20</em></p>
      <p><strong>Ages:</strong> Lisa is currently 20 years old.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Example 6 -->
    <p><strong>Example 6:</strong><br />The present ages of two friends, Sarah and Emily, are in the ratio of 5:3. If their total age is 64 years, find their present ages.</p>
    <div class="solution">
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Let Sarah's age be 5x and Emily's age be 3x.</p>
      <p>According to the problem:<br /> <em>5x + 3x = 64</em><br /> <em>8x = 64</em><br /> <em>x = 8</em></p>
      <p>So, Sarah's age is 5 &times; 8 = 40 and Emily's age is 3 &times; 8 = 24.</p>
      <p><strong>Ages:</strong> Sarah is 40 years old, and Emily is 24 years old.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Example 7 -->
    <p><strong>Example 7:</strong><br />Tom is 6 years older than Jerry. If the sum of their ages is 54 years, how old are they?</p>
    <div class="solution">
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Let Jerry's age be <em>x</em>.</p>
      <p>Then Tom's age = <em>x + 6</em>.</p>
      <p>According to the problem:<br /> <em>x + (x + 6) = 54</em><br /> <em>2x + 6 = 54</em><br /> <em>2x = 48</em><br /> <em>x = 24</em></p>
      <p>So, Tom's age = 24 + 6 = 30.</p>
      <p><strong>Ages:</strong> Tom is 30 years old, and Jerry is 24 years old.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Example 8 -->
    <p><strong>Example 8:</strong><br />The sum of the ages of a grandfather and his grandson is 70 years. If the grandfather is 5 times as old as the grandson, what are their ages?</p>
    <div class="solution">
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Let the grandson's age be <em>x</em>.</p>
      <p>Then the grandfather's age = <em>5x</em>.</p>
      <p>According to the problem:<br /> <em>x + 5x = 70</em><br /> <em>6x = 70</em><br /> <em>x = 70 / 6 &asymp; 11.67</em></p>
      <p>So, the grandfather's age is approximately 60 years, and the grandson is approximately 12 years old.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Example 9 -->
    <p><strong>Example 9:</strong><br />A woman is twice as old as her son. If the sum of their ages is 36 years, find their ages.</p>
    <div class="solution">
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Let the son's age be <em>x</em>.</p>
      <p>Then the woman's age = <em>2x</em>.</p>
      <p>According to the problem:<br /> <em>x + 2x = 36</em><br /> <em>3x = 36</em><br /> <em>x = 12</em></p>
      <p>So, the woman's age is 2 &times; 12 = 24.</p>
      <p><strong>Ages:</strong> The woman is 24 years old, and the son is 12 years old.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Example 10 -->
    <p><strong>Example 10:</strong><br />Two years ago, a father was four times as old as his son. If the father is now 38 years old, how old is the son?</p>
    <div class="solution">
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Let the son's age be <em>x</em>.</p>
      <p>Two years ago, the father's age was 36.<br /> According to the problem:<br /> <em>36 = 4(x - 2)</em><br /> <em>36 = 4x - 8</em><br /> <em>4x = 44</em><br /> <em>x = 11</em></p>
      <p><strong>Ages:</strong> The father is 38 years old, and the son is 11 years old.</p>
