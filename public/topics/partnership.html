    <h2><strong>&nbsp;Partnership</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>Key Concepts</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Investment Proportion</strong>: Profits or losses are distributed according to the ratio of the investments made by the partners. The larger the investment, the greater the share of the profit.</li>
      <li><strong>Time Factor</strong>: If partners invest their money for different periods of time, the profit share depends not only on how much they invested but also for how long the money was invested. A partner who invests for a longer period gets a higher share.</li>
      <li><strong>Profit Sharing Formula</strong>:</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Share&nbsp;of&nbsp;profit = (Individual’s&nbsp;Investment &times; Time / Total&nbsp;Investment &times; Total&nbsp;Time) &times; Total&nbsp;Profit</p>
    
    <p><strong>Types of Partnership</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Simple Partnership</strong>: In a simple partnership, all partners invest their money for the same amount of time. The profit (or loss) is shared in the ratio of their respective investments.</li>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Example</strong>: A and B invest $5000 and $3000 respectively in a business. If the total profit is $8000, what is each partner's share of the profit?</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
    <div class="solution">
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Investment ratio of A to B = 5000 : 3000 = 5 : 3</p>
      <p>A’s share of profit = (5/8)&times;8000=5000</p>
      <p>B’s share of profit = (3/8)&times;8000=3000</p>
      <p>Thus, A gets $5000 and B gets $3000 from the profit.</p>
    </div>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Compound Partnership</strong>: In a compound partnership, partners invest their money for different periods of time. The profit is divided based on the product of the investment and the time for which the investment was made.</li>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Example</strong>: A and B invest $4000 and $6000 respectively in a business. A invests for 8 months, and B invests for 6 months. If the total profit is $10,000, how is the profit divided?</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
    <div class="solution">
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>A’s investment = 4000 &times; 8 = 32000</p>
      <p>B’s investment = 6000 &times; 6 = 36000</p>
      <p>Investment ratio of A to B = 32000 : 36000 = 8 : 9</p>
      <p>A’s share of profit = (8/17)&times;10000=4705.88</p>
      <p>B’s share of profit = (9/17)&times;10000=5294.12</p>
      <p>Thus, A gets $4705.88 and B gets $5294.12 from the profit.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Examples</h3>

    <!-- Problem 1 -->
    <p><strong>Problem 1</strong><br />A and B start a business by investing $20,000 and $30,000, respectively. If they earn a total profit of $25,000 at the end of the year, what will be their individual shares of the profit?</p>
    <div class="solution">
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Investment ratio of A to B = 20,000 : 30,000 = 2 : 3</p>
      <p>A's share = (2/5) &times; 25,000 = 10,000</p>
      <p>B's share = (3/5) &times; 25,000 = 15,000</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Problem 2 -->
    <p><strong>Problem 2</strong><br />A, B, and C start a business with investments of $5000, $6000, and $9000, respectively. The total profit is $40,000. How much profit does each partner receive?</p>
    <div class="solution">
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Investment ratio = 5000 : 6000 : 9000 = 5 : 6 : 9</p>
      <p>A’s share = (5/20) &times; 40,000 = 10,000</p>
      <p>B’s share = (6/20) &times; 40,000 = 12,000</p>
      <p>C’s share = (9/20) &times; 40,000 = 18,000</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Problem 3 -->
    <p><strong>Problem 3</strong><br />A and B invest $8000 and $12,000 in a business, respectively. After 6 months, B withdraws half his investment. If the total profit at the end of the year is $20,000, find each partner's share of the profit.</p>
    <div class="solution">
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>A’s investment for the entire year = 8000 &times; 12 = 96,000</p>
      <p>B’s investment = (12,000 &times; 6) + (6000 &times; 6) = 72,000 + 36,000 = 108,000</p>
      <p>Investment ratio of A to B = 96,000 : 108,000 = 8 : 9</p>
      <p>A’s share = (8/17) &times; 20,000 = 9411.76</p>
      <p>B’s share = (9/17) &times; 20,000 = 10,588.24</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Problem 4 -->
    <p><strong>Problem 4</strong><br />A, B, and C invest $12,000, $18,000, and $24,000 respectively in a business. At the end of the year, they earn a profit of $54,000. If B and C receive a total of $45,000 from the profit, how much does A receive?</p>
    <div class="solution">
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Investment ratio of A : B : C = 12,000 : 18,000 : 24,000 = 2 : 3 : 4</p>
      <p>B’s and C’s shares = (7/9) &times; 54,000 = 42,000</p>
      <p>Remaining profit = 54,000 - 42,000 = 12,000</p>
      <p>So, A receives $12,000.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Problem 5 -->
    <p><strong>Problem 5</strong><br />X and Y started a business by investing $20,000 and $30,000 respectively. After 4 months, X withdrew $5000, and after another 4 months, Y added $5000. If the total profit is $18,000, what is each partner's share?</p>
    <div class="solution">
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>X’s investment for the first 4 months = 20,000 &times; 4 = 80,000</p>
      <p>For the next 8 months = 15,000 &times; 8 = 120,000</p>
      <p>Total = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000</p>
      <p>Y’s investment for the first 8 months = 30,000 &times; 8 = 240,000</p>
      <p>For the last 4 months = 35,000 &times; 4 = 140,000</p>
      <p>Total = 240,000 + 140,000 = 380,000</p>
      <p>Investment ratio of X to Y = 200,000 : 380,000 = 10 : 19</p>
      <p>X’s share = (10/29) &times; 18,000 = 6,206.90</p>
      <p>Y’s share = (19/29) &times; 18,000 = 11,793.10</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Problem 6 -->
    <p><strong>Problem 6</strong><br />A, B, and C enter into a partnership. A invests $2500 for the entire year, B invests $3000 for 8 months, and C invests $4500 for 6 months. If they earn a total profit of $4000, find each partner's share of the profit.</p>
    <div class="solution">
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>A’s investment = 2500 &times; 12 = 30,000</p>
      <p>B’s investment = 3000 &times; 8 = 24,000</p>
      <p>C’s investment = 4500 &times; 6 = 27,000</p>
      <p>Investment ratio = 30,000 : 24,000 : 27,000 = 10 : 8 : 9</p>
      <p>A’s share = (10/27) &times; 4000 = 1,481.48</p>
      <p>B’s share = (8/27) &times; 4000 = 1,185.19</p>
      <p>C’s share = (9/27) &times; 4000 = 1,333.33</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Problem 7 -->
    <p><strong>Problem 7</strong><br />A and B invest in a business in the ratio 5:7. After 6 months, C joins the business with an investment of $12,000. If the total profit at the end of the year is $26,400, what is C’s share of the profit?</p>
    <div class="solution">
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Let A's investment be 5x and B's investment be 7x.</p>
      <p>A’s share for 12 months = 5x &times; 12 = 60x</p>
      <p>B’s share for 12 months = 7x &times; 12 = 84x</p>
      <p>C’s share for 6 months = 12,000 &times; 6 = 72,000</p>
      <p>Ratio of A : B : C = 60x : 84x : 72,000</p>
      <p>Assume x = 1000. The ratio becomes:</p>
      <p>60,000 : 84,000 : 72,000 = 5 : 7 : 6</p>
      <p>C’s share = (6/18) &times; 26,400 = 8,800</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Problem 8 -->
    <p><strong>Problem 8</strong><br />A, B, and C start a business with investments of $6000, $8000, and $10,000 respectively. After 6 months, C withdraws half his investment. If the total profit at the end of the year is $14,000, find C's share of the profit.</p>
    <div class="solution">
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>C’s investment for the first 6 months = 10,000 &times; 6 = 60,000</p>
      <p>C’s investment for the next 6 months = 5000 &times; 6 = 30,000</p>
      <p>Total investment = 60,000 + 30,000 = 90,000</p>
      <p>Investment ratio of A : B : C = 6 : 8 : 7</p>
      <p>C’s share = (7/21) &times; 14,000 = 4,666.67</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Problem 9 -->
    <p><strong>Problem 9</strong><br />A and B enter into a partnership, investing $12,000 and $18,000 respectively. After 4 months, C joins with $24,000. If the total profit after a year is $36,000, find B’s share of the profit.</p>
    <div class="solution">
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>A’s investment = 12,000 &times; 12 = 144,000</p>
      <p>B’s investment = 18,000 &times; 12 = 216,000</p>
      <p>C’s investment = 24,000 &times; 8 = 192,000</p>
      <p>Investment ratio = 144,000 : 216,000 : 192,000 = 6 : 9 : 8</p>

    <p><strong>Problem 10</strong><br />A invests $2500 in a business. After 3 months, B joins with $3500, and after another 6 months, C joins with $4500. At the end of the year, the total profit is $5800. What is B's share of the profit?</p>
    <div class="solution">
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>A’s investment for 12 months = 2500 &times; 12 = 30,000</p>
