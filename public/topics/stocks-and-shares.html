    <h1>Stocks and Shares</h1>
    <p>Stocks and shares are financial instruments representing ownership in a company. Investors buy shares to become part-owners of a company, which entitles them to a portion of the company's profits, usually distributed as dividends. In aptitude exams, problems related to stocks and shares require you to calculate income, yield, dividends, and returns on investments based on certain conditions. Understanding these concepts is essential for solving financial problems accurately.</p>

    <h2>Key Concepts and Terminology</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Stock</strong>: A general term for ownership in a company, typically broken down into shares.</li>
      <li><strong>Share</strong>: A unit of ownership in a company’s stock.</li>
      <li><strong>Dividend</strong>: A part of the company’s profits distributed to shareholders.</li>
      <li><strong>Nominal Value (Face Value)</strong>: The fixed value of a share assigned by the company, used to calculate the dividend.</li>
      <li><strong>Market Value</strong>: The current price at which a share is trading on the stock exchange.</li>
      <li><strong>Dividend Percentage</strong>: The percentage of the nominal value paid out to shareholders as a dividend.</li>
      <li><strong>Yield (Rate of Return)</strong>: The percentage return on investment calculated based on the dividend received and the current market value of the shares.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Important Formulas</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Dividend Calculation</strong>:<br> Dividend = (Nominal Value &times; Dividend Percentage) / 100</li>
      <li><strong>Yield (Rate of Return)</strong>:<br> Yield = (Dividend / Market Value) &times; 100</li>
      <li><strong>Investment Required to Earn a Certain Income</strong>:<br> Investment = (Required Income &times; 100) / Yield</li>
      <li><strong>Number of Shares</strong>:<br> Number of Shares = Total Investment / Market Value</li>
      <li><strong>Income from Shares</strong>:<br> Income = (Dividend Percentage &times; Nominal Value &times; Number of Shares) / 100</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Detailed Examples</h2>
    <p>Below are examples that demonstrate how to calculate stocks and shares problems in different scenarios.</p>

    <div class="solution">
      <h3>Example 1: Calculating Dividend</h3>
      <p>A company declares a 10% dividend on its shares with a nominal value of ₹100. What is the dividend per share?<br><br>
      Solution:<br>
      Dividend = (Nominal Value &times; Dividend Percentage) / 100<br>
      = (100 &times; 10) / 100 = ₹10<br>
      The dividend per share is ₹10.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="solution">
      <h3>Example 2: Calculating Yield (Rate of Return)</h3>
      <p>If the market value of the share in Example 1 is ₹200, what is the yield?<br><br>
      Solution:<br>
      Yield = (Dividend / Market Value) &times; 100<br>
      = (10 / 200) &times; 100 = 5%<br>
      The yield is 5%.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="solution">
      <h3>Example 3: Calculating Investment for a Desired Income</h3>
      <p>How much should an investor invest in shares with a market value of ₹250 and a yield of 8% to earn an annual income of ₹2,000?<br><br>
      Solution:<br>
      Investment = (Required Income &times; 100) / Yield<br>
      = (2000 &times; 100) / 8 = ₹25,000<br>
      The required investment is ₹25,000.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="solution">
      <h3>Example 4: Calculating the Number of Shares from an Investment</h3>
      <p>If an investor has ₹10,000 and the market value of each share is ₹200, how many shares can they purchase?<br><br>
      Solution:<br>
      Number of Shares = Total Investment / Market Value<br>
      = 10000 / 200 = 50<br>
      The investor can purchase 50 shares.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="solution">
      <h3>Example 5: Calculating Income from Shares</h3>
      <p>A person owns 100 shares in a company with a 12% dividend rate on a nominal value of ₹50 per share. What is the income from these shares?<br><br>
      Solution:<br>
      Income = (Dividend Percentage &times; Nominal Value &times; Number of Shares) / 100<br>
      = (12 &times; 50 &times; 100) / 100 = ₹600<br>
      The income from these shares is ₹600.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="solution">
      <h3>Example 6: Calculating Market Value from Dividend and Yield</h3>
      <p>If a company pays a dividend of ₹15 on shares with a nominal value of ₹100 and the yield is 7.5%, what is the market value of each share?<br><br>
      Solution:<br>
      Market Value = (Dividend &times; 100) / Yield<br>
      = (15 &times; 100) / 7.5 = ₹200<br>
      The market value of each share is ₹200.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="solution">
      <h3>Example 7: Comparing Investments with Different Yields</h3>
      <p>An investor is comparing two investments: one offering an 8% yield and another offering a 10% yield. If they invest ₹5,000 in each, what will be the total income from both?<br><br>
      Solution:<br>
      1. Income from 8% yield = (5000 &times; 8) / 100 = ₹400<br>
      2. Income from 10% yield = (5000 &times; 10) / 100 = ₹500<br>
      Total income from both investments is ₹400 + ₹500 = ₹900.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="solution">
      <h3>Example 8: Calculating the Market Price per Share for a Desired Yield</h3>
      <p>An investor wants a yield of 10% from a company that pays an annual dividend of ₹8 per share. What should the market price per share be?<br><br>
      Solution:<br>
      Market Price = (Dividend &times; 100) / Desired Yield<br>
      = (8 &times; 100) / 10 = ₹80<br>
      The market price per share should be ₹80 for a 10% yield.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="solution">
      <h3>Example 9: Determining Total Dividend from Total Investment</h3>
      <p>An investor holds shares worth ₹30,000 in a company that declares a 15% dividend. The nominal value per share is ₹100. How much dividend will the investor receive?<br><br>
      Solution:<br>
      Total shares = 30000 / 100 = 300<br>
      Total Dividend = (300 &times; 15 &times; 100) / 100 = ₹4,500<br>
      The total dividend received is ₹4,500.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="solution">
      <h3>Example 10: Calculating Income from Different Investments</h3>
      <p>A person invests ₹12,000 in shares at 8% yield and ₹8,000 in shares at 6% yield. What is the total income from these investments?<br><br>
      Solution:<br>
      1. Income from 8% yield = (12000 &times; 8) / 100 = ₹960<br>
      2. Income from 6% yield = (8000 &times; 6) / 100 = ₹480<br>
      Total income is ₹960 + ₹480 = ₹1,440.</p>
